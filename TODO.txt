TODO
2. move endOperation logic to mode (rethink endOperation logic and mode logic)
5. change from release logic to press logic
3. Move key registrations to json/py file
6. rethink all references to tree instances that have been passed
3. normalize args for Node class
2. rethink structure, folder classification, project name
4. scaling the terminal zoom according to tree size
    - not possible to control the terminal zoom size within python
    - possible alternatives (contract large children into ...)
5. Rethink key data structure (maybe split into two classes, SingleKey, MultipleKey)

HOTFIXES
1. Fix failing testcases involving findChildNodeByName
2. Move escape sequences to terminal graphics lib
3. Add functionality to powershell
4. Fix bash help text issue

BUGS
1. bugs with calling updateTree more than once
2. dot files are not being handled in the command line arg

COMMAND LINE ARGS:
2. headHeight, tailHeight
3. showOnlyDirs
4. showDotDirs
5. showEmptyDirs
6. cycleOnSameLevel
9. searchChildNode

TESTS
1. Test tree hard coded structure - done

FEATURES (to be implemented)
1. dynamic listing (frame rate)
2. Config file for customizing key binding

DONE
1. show only dirs
2. cd into out
3. head, tail levels
4. path args
5. esc, q to quit/cancel op
7. cycle through same level
8. jump to nearest child
9. show dot dirs as well
10. jump to lowest level (leftmost and rightmost)
11. same level different parent
12. support left, right, up, down (basic) ops
13. support shortcuts (move to top root)
14. search operation support
15. Optimization - map keys to function pointers
16. Key combo for middle child
17. commandline args - copy, out to stdout, cd
18. default parent for recursive functions?
19. handle command parser
20. modify to accept command line args
21. testing all combinations for dir showing configs
22. reframe testing for traversals
23. search child node
24. multiple key presses not working
25. Implement mode
26. -h 1 -t 1, traverse ops not working - working now
27. Fix traversal issues
28. Fix permission issue
